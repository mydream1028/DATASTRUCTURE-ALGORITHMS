**Description:**
Given an array of integers, return an array of triplets (in any order) such that `i != j != k` and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] = 0`. 

Note that the solution set must not include duplicate triplets (i.e., [1, 0, 0] and [0, 1, 0] are duplicative).

## Examples:
Example 1
Input: [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4] 
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]

Example 2
Input: [1,4,5,1] 
Output: []

Example 3
Input: [0,0,0] 
Output: [[0,0,0]]
