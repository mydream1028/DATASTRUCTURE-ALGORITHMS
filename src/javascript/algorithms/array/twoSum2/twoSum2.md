**Description:**
Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

## Example:
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15,9], target = 16
Output: [2,5]
Explanation: The sum of 7 and 9 is 16. Therefore index1 = 2, index2 = 5.
